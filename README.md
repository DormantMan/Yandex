A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text)
and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or
other hierarchical structure – giving a structural representation of the input,
checking for correct syntax in the process.
The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps,
or these may be combined into a single step.

The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser,
which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters;
alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing.

Parsers may be programmed by hand or
may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a parser generator.
Parsing is complementary to templating, which produces formatted output.
These may be applied to different domains,
but often appear together,
such as the scanf/printf pair,
or the input (front end parsing)
and output (back end code generation) stages of a compiler.
